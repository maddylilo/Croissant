    <h1>Croissant 🥐</h1>
    <p class="about-text">A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other
    viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several
    times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
    flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
